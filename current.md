Monday Sept 02 is a statutory holiday. No class.

### cm 01 | Wednesday Sept 04 | Introduction to the course ([slides as PDF](2013-lectures/cm01_intro-to-course.pdf)) 

  * Complete the Google form. JB sent a link to all registered students. If you need the link, contact her by email.
  
  * Ask to join the [STAT545A_2013 Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stat545a_2013) or play hard to get and wait for us to invite you.

  * Follow some of the links that interest you in the cm01 lecture slides (link to PDF above). Would be great if people started a thread on the Google group suggesting more or better blogs or articles hitting the same topics or pointing out broken links.
  
  * Work through
    - [Get R, RStudio, and some add-on packages set up](block00_setup.html)
    - [Basics of R/RStudio, workspaces, and projects](block01_basicsWorkspaceWorkingDirProject.html) <-- Really important that you show up Monday having completed this tutorial. Have that `toyline.R` script ready to work with.
    
  * Sign up for an account at [Rpubs.com](http://rpubs.com). We will try this as the first and gentlest method of generating finished work for this course. JB has [conducted a test](http://rpubs.com/jennybc) and it's dead easy. We'll get you started on Monday.

### cm 02 | Monday Sept 09 | Create first report, Deep Thoughts, Basic care and feeding of data in R ([slides as PDF](2013-lectures/cm02_compileNotebook-publishRpubs-deepThoughts.pdf))

  * Sign up for an educational account at [github.com/edu](https://github.com/edu). **Take advantage of their special deal for students, where you can get something like 5 private repositories for two years for free.** We will experiment with students modifying [the course repository](https://github.com/jennybc/STAT545A) via a [browser-based workflow](https://github.com/blog/1557-github-flow-in-the-browser) for those who do not wish to take the git plunge yet. I will not require you to create or share your own repositories -- you just need a github account in order to edit mine, e.g. the course repository. Usage cases I have in mind:
    - Submitting coursework by adding a link to work you've published on [Rpubs.com](http://rpubs.com)
    - Suggesting a dataset to work on later in the class or commenting on suggestions made by others
    
  * Work through
    - [Basic care and feeding of data in R](block02_careFeedingData.html)
    
  * Feel free to start thinking about some datasets we could work with later in the class
    - [Early draft of a "dataset ideas" page](dataset-ideas.html)

### cm 03 | Wednesday Sept 11 | R objects (beyond data.frames) and R Markdown ([slides as PDF](2013-lectures/cm03_workModes-flavorsCollections-RMarkdown.pdf))

  * [How to submit homework](hw00_instructions.html)

  * Submit [homework 1](hw01_compileNotebook.html) ASAP.
  
  * Submit [homework 2](hw02_rmarkdownGapminder.html) before class starts @ 9:30am Monday Sept. 16.
  
  * Work through
    - [R objects (beyond data.frames) and indexing](block03_basicObjects.html). Note: you should be able to do the homework before completing this tutorial.

### cm 04 | Monday Sept 16 | *Tentative: Univariate statistics and visual summaries. Data aggregation.*

Wednesday Sept 18 UBC's observance of [National Reconciliation Week](http://irsi.aboriginal.ubc.ca). No class.

* Work through
    - a tutorial on univariate statistics and visual summaries and/or data aggregation?

  * Post a serious proposal for a dataset and/or make a thoughtful contribution to the discussion of an existing proposal. We need to start fleshing these out. The time needed for data assembly and cleaning is going to break your heart.
  
  * Spend an hour (or more if you are new to the command line and scripting) reading these resources about how to ask for help. Don't be paranoid, this is not about you and that question you asked the other day! This material has been in the course for a couple of years. This is another aspect of the culture that one has to actually learn.
  
    - The 9th circle of R hell in [The R Inferno](http://www.burns-stat.com/documents/books/the-r-inferno/) by Patrick Burns.
    - [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond.
    - The [posting guide](http://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html) for [the R-help mailing list](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help), which I recommend you NOT post to any time soon. (But by all means, search for answers to your questions there!) Turn to Jenny, Song, and the Google Group first for now.
